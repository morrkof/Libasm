# Practice projects: libasm
The goal of this project it to re-write several C-function from C Standard Library, using assembly language (NASM).

#### Command to compile the library (linux):
`make`

#### Command to run some tests (linux):
`make test`

#### list of functions:
1. strlen
2. strcpy
3. strcmp
4. strdup
5. read
6. write

I used the 64-bits ASM with Intel syntax. Each function contains detailed comments.
